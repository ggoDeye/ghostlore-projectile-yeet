  <name>Projectile Yeet</name>
  <description>This is intended for players pushing the depths of hell and maximizing projectile radius. This will let you see the game again instead of explosions/poison. I don't suggest using this unless your total Increased Projectile Radius is greater than 1000%.
  Experimental mod that attempts to modify game sprites by intercepting certain sprites and moving them off-screen. This is a proof-of-concept and likely has bugs. Backup your saves before using.</description>
