  <name>Projectile Yeet</name>
  <description>This is intended for players pushing the depths of hell and maximizing projectile radius. This will let you see the game again instead of explosions poison. I don't suggest using this unless your total Increased Projectile Radius prevents you from seeing the character/map/Orang Bunian/etc.
Earaly stage mod that attempts to intercepting certain sprites and moving them off-screen. This is a proof-of-concept and likely has bugs. Backup your saves before using.
